    "# Component evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we take a CNM object and evaluate all of its components to filter out false positives and only keep real neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is done following these criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Spatial footprint consistency (rval): The spatial footprint of the component is compared with the frames where this component is active. Other componentâ€™s signals are subtracted from these frames, and the resulting raw data is correlated against the spatial component. This ensures that the raw data at the spatial footprint aligns with the extracted trace.\n",
    " - Trace signal-noise-ratio (SNR): Peak SNR is calculated from strong calcium transients and the noise estimate.\n",
    " - CNN-based classifier (cnn): The shape of components is evaluated by a 4-layered convolutional neural network trained on a manually annotated dataset. The CNN assigns a value of 0-1 to each component depending on its resemblance to a neuronal soma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each parameter has a low threshold (*rval_lowest* (default -1), *SNR_lowest* (default 0.5), *cnn_lowest* (default 0.1)) and high threshold (*rval_thr* (default 0.8), *min_SNR* (default 2.5), *min_cnn_thr* (default 0.9)). A component has to exceed ALL low thresholds as well as ONE high threshold to be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to run the evaluation several times, check how the evaluation looks (if neurons are accepted and noise is rejected), adjust the parameters and run the evaluation again. Repeat this process until (almost) all neurons are accepted with as little false-positives as possible."
