abstract = {Recording of glutamate-activated currents in membrane patches was combined with RT-PCR-mediated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit mRNA analysis in single identified cells of rat brain slices. Analysis of AMPARs in principal neurons and interneurons of hippocampus and neocortex and in auditory relay neurons and Bergmann glial cells indicates that the GluR-B subunit in its flip version determines formation of receptors with relatively slow gating, whereas the GluR-D subunit promotes assembly of more rapidly gated receptors. The relation between Ca 2+ permeability of AMPAR channels and the relative GluR-B mRNA abundance is consistent with the dominance of this subunit in determining the Ca 2+ permeability of native receptors. The results suggest that differential expression of GluR-B and GluR-D subunit genes, as well as splicing and editing of their mRNAs, account for the differences in gating and Ca 2+ permeability of native AMPAR channels. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine in the brain alters neuronal excitability, influences synaptic transmission, induces synaptic plasticity and coordinates the firing of groups of neurons. As a result, it changes the state of neuronal networks throughout the brain and modifies their response to internal and external inputs: the classical role of a neuromodulator. Here we identify actions of cholinergic signaling on cellular and synaptic properties of neurons in several brain areas and discuss the consequences of this signaling on behaviors related to drug abuse, attention, food intake, and affect. The diverse effects of acetylcholine depend on the site of release, the receptor subtypes, and the target neuronal population, however, a common theme is that acetylcholine potentiates behaviors that are adaptive to environmental stimuli and decreases responses to ongoing stimuli that do not require immediate action. The ability of acetylcholine to coordinate the response of neuronal networks in many brain areas makes cholinergic modulation an essential mechanism underlying complex behaviors.},

abstract = {The success story of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV(+)) GABAergic interneurons (GABA, $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) in the mammalian central nervous system is noteworthy. In 1995, the properties of these interneurons were completely unknown. Twenty years later, thanks to the massive use of subcellular patch-clamp techniques, simultaneous multiple-cell recording, optogenetics, in vivo measurements, and computational approaches, our knowledge about PV(+) interneurons became more extensive than for several types of pyramidal neurons. These findings have implications beyond the "small world" of basic research on GABAergic cells. For example, the results provide a first proof of principle that neuroscientists might be able to close the gaps between the molecular, cellular, network, and behavioral levels, representing one of the main challenges at the present time. Furthermore, the results may form the basis for PV(+) interneurons as therapeutic targets for brain disease in the future. However, much needs to be learned about the basic function of these interneurons before clinical neuroscientists will be able to use PV(+) interneurons for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of several single-shot imaging techniques to local field gradients (LFGs) generated by discontinuities in bulk magnetic susceptibility (BMS) were compared in mouse brain at 7.0 T. At high field, differences in BMS can cause substantial signal attenuation and image distortion. Because susceptibility effects scale with B(o), mouse brain single-shot imaging at high field is particularly susceptible to the effects of LFGs. The spin-echo techniques GRASE and RARE were found to have a decreased sensitivity to LFGs compared to echo-planar imaging (EPI). Images obtained using EPI and SE-EPI exhibit severe signal attenuation in regions of high LFGs such as near air-tissue interfaces and at the brain edges. In applications such as functional MRI and diffusion MRI, GRASE and RARE are likely to provide more comprehensive whole brain coverage in mouse brain at high field than EPI techniques, which are likely to image regions of the brain with strong LFGs with low signal to noise, reducing the probability of detecting significant physiologically based changes.},

In the proposed mixer, the double balanced Gilbert cell topology was adopted and the dual resistive current-reuse and current-bleeding techniques in both the driver and switching stages with a capacitive cross-coupling technique were used. The up-conversion mixer can convert a 10 MHz intermediate frequency signal to a 2.4 GHz radio frequency signal, with a local oscillator power of 0 dBm at 2.39 GHz. A comparison with conventional CMOS mixer shows that this up-conversion mixer has advantages of low voltage, low power consumption and high performance. The post-layout simulation results demonstrate that at 2.4 GHz, the circuit provides 7.1 dB of conversion gain and the input-referred third-order intercept point of 11.3 dBm, while drawing only 5 mA for the mixer core under a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The chip area including testing pads is only 0.65 × 0.75 mm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This diversity poses general questions for neural circuit analysis: how are these interneuron cell types generated and assembled into stereotyped local circuits and how do they differentially contribute to circuit operations that underlie cortical functions ranging from perception to cognition? Using genetic engineering in mice, we have generated and characterized approximately 20 Cre and inducible CreER knockin driver lines that reliably target major classes and lineages of GABAergic neurons. More select populations are captured by intersection of Cre and Flp drivers. Genetic targeting allows reliable identification, monitoring, and manipulation of cortical GABAergic neurons, thereby enabling a systematic and comprehensive analysis from cell fate specification, migration, and connectivity, to their functions in network dynamics and behavior. As such, this approach will accelerate the study of GABAergic circuits throughout the mammalian brain.},

Selective attention enhances the responses of sensory nerve cells to whatever is being observed and dampens responses to any distractions. Zhang et al. identified a region of the mouse forebrain that modulates responses in the visual cortex. This modulation improved the mouse{\textquoteright}s performance in a visual task.Science, this issue p. 660 Top-down modulation of sensory processing allows the animal to select inputs most relevant to current tasks. We found that the cingulate (Cg) region of the mouse frontal cortex powerfully influences sensory processing in the primary visual cortex (V1) through long-range projections that activate local γ-aminobutyric acid{\textendash}ergic (GABAergic) circuits. Optogenetic activation of Cg neurons enhanced V1 neuron responses and improved visual discrimination. Focal activation of Cg axons in V1 caused a response increase at the activation site but a decrease at nearby locations (center-surround modulation). Whereas somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons contributed preferentially to surround suppression, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive interneurons were crucial for center facilitation. Long-range corticocortical projections thus act through local microcircuits to exert spatially specific top-down modulation of sensory processing.},

	abstract="The neocortex is regarded as the brain structure responsible for mediating higher brain functions, like conscious perception of sensory signals, learning and memory or programming of goal-directed behavior. Cortical circuits that enable these functions are formed by, first, a larger population of excitatory so-called principal cells (i.e., glutamatergic pyramidal cells; ca. 80--85{\thinspace}{\%}), which issue long-distance projections, in addition to local recurrent collaterals, which form the major part of local cortical excitatory circuits. A second, smaller population of inhibitory also called local or short-axoned interneurons (i.e., GABAergic neurons; ca. 15--20{\thinspace}{\%}), however, contribute heavily to intracortical microcircuits too. They can be subdivided by their location in specific areas, layers, or columns, which possess specific input--output relationships, but also in terms of morphology, electrophysiology, molecular expression profiles, and subcellular target specificity. Here it is proposed that, at present, in the rodent neocortex this population of GABAergic neurons can be reasonably divided into six different types, mainly due to their unique axonal patterns and subcellular target specificity: (i) axo-axonic cells, (ii) basket cells, (iii) Martinotti cells, (iv) bipolar/bitufted cells, (v) neurogliaform cells, and (vi) projection neurons. These different types of GABAergic neurons strongly govern the working of cortical circuits for meaningful behavior by feed-forward and feedback inhibition as well as disinhibition. Thus, they keep excitation in check, perform gain modulation, and open temporal or spatial windows for input control or output generation.",

abstract = {Neocortical GABAergic interneurons have a profound impact on cortical circuitry and its information processing capacity. Distinct subgroups of inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished by molecular markers, such as parvalbumin, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Among these, VIP-expressing interneurons sparked a substantial interest since these neurons seem to operate disinhibitory circuit motifs found in all major neocortical areas. Several of these recent studies used transgenic Vip-ires-cre mice to specifically target the population of VIP-expressing interneurons. This makes it necessary to elucidate in detail the sensitivity and specificity of Cre expression for VIP neurons in these animals. Thus, we quantitatively compared endogenous tdTomato with Vip fluorescence in situ hybridization and $\alpha$VIP immunohistochemistry in the barrel cortex of VIPcre/tdTomato mice in a layer-specific manner. We show that VIPcre/tdTomato mice are highly sensitive and specific for the entire population of VIP-expressing neurons. In the barrel cortex, approximately 13{\%} of all GABAergic neurons are VIP expressing. Most VIP neurons are found in layer II/III (∼60{\%}), whereas approximately 40{\%} are found in the other layers of the barrel cortex. Layer II/III VIP neurons are significantly different from VIP neurons in layers IV-VI in several morphological and membrane properties, which suggest layer-dependent differences in functionality.},

abstract = {Cortical inhibitory circuits play important roles in shaping sensory processing. In auditory cortex, however, functional properties of genetically identified inhibitory neurons are poorly characterized. By two-photon imaging-guided recordings, we specifically targeted 2 major types of cortical inhibitory neuron, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) expressing neurons, in superficial layers of mouse auditory cortex. We found that PV cells exhibited broader tonal receptive fields with lower intensity thresholds and stronger tone-evoked spike responses compared with SOM neurons. The latter exhibited similar frequency selectivity as excitatory neurons. The broader/weaker frequency tuning of PV neurons was attributed to a broader range of synaptic inputs and stronger subthreshold responses elicited, which resulted in a higher efficiency in the conversion of input to output. In addition, onsets of both the input and spike responses of SOM neurons were significantly delayed compared with PV and excitatory cells. Our results suggest that PV and SOM neurons engage in auditory cortical circuits in different manners: while PV neurons may provide broadly tuned feedforward inhibition for a rapid control of ascending inputs to excitatory neurons, the delayed and more selective inhibition from SOM neurons may provide a specific modulation of feedback inputs on their distal dendrites.},

Here, we find that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ChAT-VIP neurons directly excite interneurons in layers (L)1-3 as well as pyramidal neurons in L2/3 and L6 by fast cholinergic transmission. Dual recordings of presynaptic ChAT-VIP neurons and postsynaptic L1 interneurons show fast nicotinic receptor currents strictly time-locked to single presynaptic action potentials. A fraction (10-20{\%}) of postsynaptic neurons that received cholinergic input from ChAT-VIP interneurons also received GABAergic input from these neurons. In contrast to regular VIP interneurons, ChAT-VIP neurons did not disinhibit pyramidal neurons, but instead depolarized fast spiking and low threshold spiking interneurons. Finally, we find that ChAT-VIP neurons control attention behaviour distinctly from basal forebrain ACh inputs to mPFC. Our findings show that ChAT-VIP neurons are a local source of cortical ACh, that directly excite pyramidal and interneurons throughout cortical layers.},

abstract = {The cholinergic system is a potent neuromodulatory system that plays critical roles in cortical plasticity, attention and learning. In this review, we propose that the cellular effects of acetylcholine (ACh) in the primary visual cortex during the processing of visual inputs might induce perceptual learning; i.e., long-term changes in visual perception. Specifically, the pairing of cholinergic activation with visual stimulation increases the signal-to-noise ratio, cue detection ability and long-term facilitation in the primary visual cortex. This cholinergic enhancement would increase the strength of thalamocortical afferents to facilitate the treatment of a novel stimulus while decreasing the cortico-cortical signaling to reduce recurrent or top-down modulation. This balance would be mediated by different cholinergic receptor subtypes that are located on both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the different cortical layers. The mechanisms of cholinergic enhancement are closely linked to attentional processes, long-term potentiation (LTP) and modulation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Recently, it was found that boosting the cholinergic system during visual training robustly enhances sensory perception in a long-term manner. Our hypothesis is that repetitive pairing of cholinergic and sensory stimulation over a long period of time induces long-term changes in the processing of trained stimuli that might improve perceptual ability. Various non-invasive approaches to the activation of the cholinergic neurons have strong potential to improve visual perception.},

abstract = {During behavioral quiescence, such as slow-wave sleep and anesthesia, the neocortex is in a deactivated state characterized by the presence of slow oscillations. During arousal, slow oscillations are absent and the neocortex is in an activated state that greatly impacts information processing. Neuromodulators acting in neocortex are believed to mediate these state changes, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the actions of noradrenergic and cholinergic activation on slow oscillations, cellular excitability, and synaptic inputs in thalamocortical slices of somatosensory cortex. The results show that neuromodulation abolishes slow oscillations, dampens the excitability of principal cells, and rebalances excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in thalamocortical-recipient layers IV-III. Sensory cortex is much more selective about the inputs that can drive it. The source of neuromodulation is critically important in determining this selectivity. Cholinergic activation suppresses the excitatory and inhibitory conductances driven by thalamocortical and intracortical inputs. Noradrenergic activation suppresses the excitatory conductance driven by intracortical inputs but not by thalamocortical inputs and enhances the inhibitory conductance driven by thalamocortical inputs but not by intracortical inputs. Thus noradrenergic activation emphasizes thalamocortical (sensory) inputs relative to intracortical inputs, while cholinergic activation suppresses both.},

abstract = {The traditional classification of primary motor cortex (M1) as an agranular area  has been challenged recently when a functional layer 4 (L4) was reported in M1. L4 is the principal target for thalamic input in sensory areas, which raises the question of how thalamocortical synapses formed in M1 in the mouse compare with those in neighboring sensory cortex (S1). We identified thalamic boutons by their immunoreactivity for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) and performed unbiased disector counts from electron micrographs. We discovered that the thalamus contributed proportionately only half as many synapses to the local circuitry of L4 in M1 compared with S1. Furthermore, thalamic boutons in M1 targeted spiny dendrites exclusively, whereas approximately 9{\%} of synapses were formed with dendrites of smooth neurons in S1. VGluT2(+) boutons in M1 were smaller and formed fewer synapses per bouton on average (1.3 vs 2.1) than those in S1, but VGluT2(+) synapses in M1 were larger than in S1 (median postsynaptic density areas of 0.064 mum(2) vs 0.042 mum(2)). In M1 and S1, thalamic synapses formed only a small fraction (12.1{\%} and 17.2{\%}, respectively) of all of the asymmetric synapses in L4. The functional role of the thalamic input to L4 in M1 has largely been neglected, but our data suggest that, as in S1, the thalamic input is amplified by the recurrent excitatory connections of the L4 circuits. The lack of direct thalamic input to inhibitory neurons in M1 may indicate temporal differences in the inhibitory gating in L4 of M1 versus S1.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Classical interpretations of the function of primary motor cortex (M1) emphasize its lack of the granular layer 4 (L4) typical of sensory cortices. However, we show here that, like sensory cortex (S1), mouse M1 also has the canonical circuit motif of a core thalamic input to the middle cortical layer and that thalamocortical synapses form a small fraction (M1: 12{\%}; S1: 17{\%}) of all asymmetric synapses in L4 of both areas. Amplification of thalamic input by recurrent local circuits is thus likely to be a significant mechanism in both areas. Unlike M1, where thalamocortical boutons typically form a single synapse, thalamocortical boutons in S1 usually formed multiple synapses, which means they can be identified with high probability in the electron microscope without specific labeling.},

abstract = {Neocortex, the neuronal structure at the base of the remarkable cognitive skills of mammals, is a layered sheet of neuronal tissue composed of juxtaposed and interconnected columns. A cortical column is considered the basic module of cortical processing present in all cortical areas. It is believed to contain a characteristic microcircuit composed of a few thousand neurons. The high degree of cortical segmentation into vertical columns and horizontal layers is a boon for scientific investigation because it eases the systematic dissection and functional analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic connections of the column. In this review we will argue that in order to understand neocortical function one needs to combine a microscopic view, elucidating the workings of the local columnar microcircuits, with a macroscopic view, which keeps track of the linkage of distant cortical modules in different behavioral contexts.We will exemplify this strategy using the model system of vibrissal touch in mice and rats. On the macroscopic level vibrissal touch is an important sense for the subterranean rodents and has been honed by evolution to serve an array of distinct behaviors. Importantly, the vibrissae are moved actively to touch - requiring intricate sensorimotor interactions. Vibrissal touch, therefore, offers ample opportunities to relate different behavioral contexts to specific interactions of distant columns. On the microscopic level, the cortical modules in primary somatosensory cortex process touch inputs at highest magnification and discreteness - each whisker is represented by its own so-called barrel column. The cellular composition, intrinsic connectivity and functional aspects of the barrel column have been studied in great detail.Building on the versatility of genetic tools available in rodents, new, highly selective and flexible cellular and molecular tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity have been devised. Researchers have started to combine these with advanced and highly precise behavioral methods, on par with the precision known from monkey preparations. Therefore, the vibrissal touch model system is exquisitely positioned to combine the microscopic with the macroscopic view and promises to be instrumental in our understanding of neocortical function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cortical topography can be remapped as a consequence of sensory deprivation, suggesting that cortical circuits are continually modified by experience. To see the effect of altered sensory experience on specific components of cortical circuits, we imaged neurons, labeled with a genetically modified adeno-associated virus, in the intact mouse somatosensory cortex before and after whisker plucking. Following whisker plucking we observed massive and rapid reorganization of the axons of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, accompanied by a transient increase in bouton density. For horizontally projecting axons of excitatory neurons there was a net increase in axonal projections from the non-deprived whisker barrel columns into the deprived barrel columns. The axon collaterals of inhibitory neurons located in the deprived whisker barrel columns retracted in the vicinity of their somata and sprouted long-range projections beyond their normal reach towards the non-deprived whisker barrel columns. These results suggest that alterations in the balance of excitation and inhibition in deprived and non-deprived barrel columns underlie the topographic remapping associated with sensory deprivation.},

New optical, electrophysiological, and genetic methods allow detailed in vivo investigation of the superficial neocortical layers 2 and 3 (L2/3). Here, we review current knowledge of mouse L2/3 sensory cortex, focusing on somatosensory barrel cortex with comparisons to visual and auditory cortex. Broadly tuned, dense subthreshold synaptic input accompanied by sparse action potential (AP) firing in excitatory neurons provides a simple and reliable neural code useful for associative learning. Sparse AP firing is enforced by strong inhibition from genetically defined classes of GABAergic neurons. Subnetworks of strongly and specifically connected excitatory neurons may drive L2/3 network function, with potential contributions from dendritic spikes evoked by spatiotemporally clustered synaptic input. These functional properties of L2/3 are under profound regulation by brain state and behavior, providing interesting avenues for future mechanistic investigations into context-specific processing of sensory information},

abstract = {Chemical fixation is nearly indispensable in the biological sciences, especially in  circumstances where cryo-fixation is not applicable. While universally employed for the preservation of cell organization, chemical fixatives often introduce artifacts that can confound identification of true structures. Since biological research is increasingly probing ever-finer details of the cellular architecture, it is critical to understand the nanoscale transformation of the cellular organization due to fixation both systematically and quantitatively. In this work, we employed Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) Microscopy, a nanoscale sensitive and label-free live cell spectroscopic-imaging technique, to analyze the effects of the fixation process through three commonly used fixation protocols for cells in vitro. In each method investigated, we detected dramatic difference in both nuclear and cytoplasmic nanoarchitecture between live and fixed states. But significantly, despite the alterations in cellular nanoscale organizations after chemical fixation, the population differences in chromatin structure (e.g. induced by a specific chemotherapeutic agent) remains. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the nanoscale cellular arrangement observed in fixed cells was fundamentally divorced from that in live cells, thus the quantitative analysis is only meaningful on the population level. This finding highlights the importance of live cell imaging techniques with nanoscale sensitivity or cryo-fixation in the interrogation of cellular structure, to complement more traditional chemical fixation methods.},

abstract = {Synaptic circuits bind together functional modules of the neocortex. We aim to clarify in a rodent model how intra- and transcolumnar microcircuits in the barrel cortex are laid out to segregate and also integrate sensory information. The primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex of rodents is the ideal model system to study these issues because there, the tactile information derived from the large facial whiskers on the snout is mapped onto so called barrel-related columns which altogether form an isomorphic map of the sensory periphery. This allows to functionally interpret the synaptic microcircuits we have been analyzing in barrel-related columns by means of whole-cell recordings, biocytin filling and mapping of intracortical functional connectivity with sublaminar specificity by computer-controlled flash-release of glutamate. We find that excitatory spiny neurons (spiny stellate, star pyramidal, and pyramidal cells) show a layer-specific connectivity pattern on top of which further cell type-specific circuits can be distinguished. The main features are: (a) strong intralaminar, intracolumnar connections are established by all types of excitatory neurons with both, excitatory and (except for layer Vb- intrinsically burst-spiking-pyramidal cells) inhibitory cells; (b) effective translaminar, intracolumnar connections become more abundant along the three main layer compartments of the canonical microcircuit, and (c) extensive transcolumnar connectivity is preferentially found in specific cell types in each of the layer compartments of a barrel-related column. These multiple sequential and parallel circuits are likely to be suitable for specific cortical processing of "what" "where" and "when" aspects of tactile information acquired by the whiskers on the snout.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive description of the organization of projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, which together with projections to other subfields of the hippocampal formation form the so-called perforant pathway. To this end, data that are primarily from anatomical studies in the rat will be summarized, complimented with comparative data from other species. The analysis of the organization of any of the connections of the hippocampus, including that of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, is severely hampered because of the complex three-dimensional shape of the hippocampus. In particular in rodents, but to a lesser extent also in primates, all traditional planes of sectioning will result in sections that at some point or another do not cut through the hippocampus at an angle that is perpendicular to its long axis. To amend this, we will describe own unpublished tracing data obtained in the rat with the use of the so-called extended preparation. A number of issues will be addressed. First, data will be summarized which will clarify the laminar origin of the perforant pathway within the entorhinal cortex. Second, we will discuss whether or not a radial organization, along the proximo-distal dendritic axis of granule cells, characterizes the entorhinal-dentate projection. Third, we will discuss whether this projection is governed by any transverse organization, and fourth, we will focus on the organization along the longitudinal axis. Finally, the synaptic organization and the contralateral entorhinal-dentate projection will be described briefly. Taken together, the available data suggest that the projection from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus is a fairly well conserved connection, present in all species studied, exhibiting a grossly similar organization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Volume transmission (VT) is a widespread mode of intercellular communication that occurs in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the brain with VT signals moving from source to target cells via energy gradients leading to diffusion and convection (flow). The VT channels are diffuse forming a plexus in the extracellular space, while in wiring transmission (WT) the channels (axons, terminals) are private. The speed is slow (seconds-minutes) in VT while rapid in the millisecond range in WT. The extracellular space is the substrate for VT, which is modulated by the extracellular matrix. Extrasynaptic VT is linked to synaptic transmission and likely often takes place due to incomplete diffusion barriers with the synaptic transmitter reaching extrasynaptic domains of the pre-and post-synaptic membrane of the synapse, the astroglia, and even adjacent synapses. Indications exist for the existence of striatal D2-like receptor-mediated extrasynaptic form of dopamine (DA) VT at the local circuit level in vivo in the human striatum. Synaptic glutamate via extrasynaptic VT can act on extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors located on the astroglia leading to Ca(2+) mediated astrocytic glutamate release into the extracellular space (ECS). Long distance peptide VT and CSF VT is the major long distance VT with distances more than 1 mm and flow in the CSF. Indications for long distance VT of beta-endorphin and oxytocin are obtained. We propose that monogamy in the female prairie vole may take place through an increase in oxytocin VT, especially in nucleus accumbens. Release of extracellular vesicles containing receptors, proteins, RNAs and mtDNA from cellular networks in the central nervous system (CNS) into the ECF and CSF may be a fundamental communication in the CNS. It represents a special form of volume transmission, the Roamer subtype of VT. It may greatly contribute to dynamic events of synaptic plasticity but also to spread of pathological proteins in protein conformational disorders. VT also occurs in the peripheral nervous system and associated cells. Short and long distance VT may take place in meridian channels via diffusion and flow in the interstitial fluid. Acupuncture can produce VT signals by releasing transmitters and modulators from nerve terminals and mast cells.},

abstract = {The prion paradigm has emerged as a unifying molecular principle for the pathogenesis of many age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This paradigm holds that a fundamental cause of specific disorders is the misfolding and seeded aggregation of certain proteins. The concept arose from the discovery that devastating brain diseases called spongiform encephalopathies are transmissible to new hosts by agents consisting solely of a misfolded protein, now known as the prion protein. Accordingly, “prion” was defined as a “proteinaceous infectious particle.” As the concept has expanded to include other diseases, many of which are not infectious by any conventional definition, the designation of prions as infectious agents has become problematic. We propose to define prions as “proteinaceous nucleating particles” to highlight the molecular action of the agents, lessen unwarranted apprehension about the transmissibility of noninfectious proteopathies, and promote the wider acceptance of this revolutionary paradigm by the biomedical community.},

abstract = {Internal brain states affect sensory perception, cognition, and learning. Many neocortical areas exhibit changes in the pattern and synchrony of neuronal activity during quiet versus active behaviors. Active behaviors are typically associated with desynchronized cortical dynamics. Increased thalamic firing contributes importantly to desynchronize mouse barrel cortex during active whisker sensing. However, a whisking-related cortical state change persists after thalamic inactivation, which is mediated at least in part by acetylcholine, as we show here by using whole-cell recordings, local pharmacology, axonal calcium imaging, and optogenetic stimulation. During whisking, we find prominent cholinergic signals in the barrel cortex, which suppress spontaneous cortical activity. The desynchronized state of barrel cortex during whisking is therefore driven by at least two distinct signals with opposing functions: increased thalamic activity driving glutamatergic excitation of the cortex and increased cholinergic input suppressing spontaneous cortical activity.},

To unravel the circuit by which activity in the primary vibrissal motor cortex (vM1) modulates sensory processing in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), we used optogenetics to examine the long-range inputs from vM1 to the various neuronal elements in S1. We found that S1-projecting vM1 pyramidal neurons strongly recruited vasointestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, a subset of serotonin receptor-expressing interneurons. These VIP interneurons preferentially inhibited somatostatin-expressing interneurons, neurons that target the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells. Consistent with this vM1-mediated disinhibitory circuit, the activity of VIP interneurons in vivo increased and that of somatostatin interneurons decreased during whisking. These changes in firing rates during whisking depended on vM1 activity. Our results suggest previously unknown circuitry by which inputs from motor cortex influence sensory processing in sensory cortex.},

Here, we reengineer the interaction between the light inducible dimer, iLID, and its binding partner SspB, to better control proteins present at high effective concentrations (5-100 µM). iLID contains a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a conformational change upon activation with blue light and exposes a peptide motif, ssrA, that binds to SspB. The new variant of the dimer system, contains a single SspB point mutation (A58V), and displays a 42-fold change in binding affinity when activated with blue light (from 3 ± 2 µM to 125 ± 40 µM), and allows for light...},

However, interpreting the observed changes as modifications in neuronal connectivity needs information about synapses. We show here that axons and dendrites of GFP-labeled neurons imaged previously in the live mouse or in slice preparations using 2-photon laser microscopy can be analyzed using light and electron microscopy, allowing morphological reconstruction of the synapses both on the imaged neurons, as well as those in the surrounding neuropil. We describe how, over a 2-day period, the imaged tissue is fixed, sliced and immuno-labeled to localize the neurons of interest. Once embedded in epoxy resin, the entire neuron can then be drawn in three dimensions (3D) for detailed morphological analysis using light microscopy. Specific dendrites and axons can be further serially thin sectioned, imaged in the electron microscope (EM) and then the ultrastructure analyzed on the serial images.},

abstract = {Cortical calretinin (CR)-expressing interneurons represent a heterogeneous subpopulation of about 10-30{\%} of GABAergic interneurons, which altogether total ca. 12-20{\%} of all cortical neurons. In the rodent neocortex, CR cells display different somatodendritic morphologies ranging from bipolar to multipolar but the bipolar cells and their variations dominate. They are also diverse at the molecular level as they were shown to express numerous neuropeptides in different combinations including vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK), neurokinin B (NKB) corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), enkephalin (Enk) but also neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin (SOM) to a lesser extent. CR-expressing interneurons exhibit different firing behaviors such as adapting, bursting or irregular. They mainly originate from the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) but a subpopulation also derives from the dorsal part of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Cortical GABAergic CR-expressing interneurons can be divided in two main populations: VIP-bipolar interneurons deriving from the CGE and SOM-Martinotti-like interneurons originating in the dorsal MGE. Although bipolar cells account for the majority of CR-expressing interneurons, the roles they play in cortical neuronal circuits and in the more general metabolic physiology of the brain remained elusive and enigmatic. The aim of this review is, firstly, to provide a comprehensive view of the morphological, molecular and electrophysiological features defining this cell type. We will, secondly, also summarize what is known about their place in the cortical circuit, their modulation by subcortical afferents and the functional roles they might play in neuronal processing and energy metabolism.},

In all multipolar neurons the fine structure of the initial segment has the same pattern, whether or not the axon is ensheathed in myelin. The internal structure of the initial segment is characterized by three special features: (a) a dense layer of finely granular material undercoating the plasma membrane, (b) scattered clusters of ribosomes, and (c) fascicles of microtubules. A similar undercoating occurs beneath the plasma membrane of myelinated axons at nodes of Ranvier. The ribosomes are not organized into Nissl bodies and are too sparsely distributed to produce basophilia. They vanish at the end of the initial segment. Fascicles of microtubules occur only in the axon hillock and initial segment and nowhere else in the neuron. Therefore, they are the principal identifying mark. Some speculations are presented on the relation between these special structural features and the special function of the initial segment.},

abstract = {Neocortical acetylcholine (ACH) release is known to enhance signal processing by increasing the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensory responses. It is widely accepted that the larger sensory responses are caused by a persistent increase in the excitability of all cortical excitatory neurons. Here, contrary to this concept, we show that ACH persistently inhibits layer 4 (L4) spiny neurons, the main targets of thalamocortical inputs. Using whole-cell recordings in slices of rat primary somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate that this inhibition is specific to L4 and contrasts with the ACH-induced persistent excitation of pyramidal cells in L2/3 and L5. We find that this inhibition is induced by postsynaptic M(4)-muscarinic ACH receptors and is mediated by the opening of inwardly rectifying potassium (K(ir)) channels. Pair recordings of L4 spiny neurons show that ACH reduces synaptic release in the L4 recurrent microcircuit. We conclude that ACH has a differential layer-specific effect that results in a filtering of weak sensory inputs in the L4 recurrent excitatory microcircuit and a subsequent amplification of relevant inputs in L2/3 and L5 excitatory microcircuits. This layer-specific effect may contribute to improve cortical SNR.},

However, whether rapid changes in basal forebrain neuron spiking in awake animals can dynamically influence sensory perception is unclear. Here we show that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons rapidly regulate cortical activity and visual perception in awake, behaving mice. Optogenetic activation of the cholinergic neurons or their V1 axon terminals improved performance of a visual discrimination task on a trial-by-trial basis. In V1, basal forebrain activation enhanced visual responses and desynchronized neuronal spiking; these changes could partly account for the behavioral improvement. Conversely, optogenetic basal forebrain inactivation decreased behavioral performance, synchronized cortical activity and impaired visual responses, indicating the importance of cholinergic activity in normal visual processing. These results underscore the causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in fast, bidirectional modulation of cortical processing and sensory perception.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter critical for normal cognition. Here we demonstrate heterogeneity of cholinergic signaling in neocortical neurons in the rat prefrontal, somatosensory, and visual cortex. Focal ACh application (100 muM) inhibited layer 5 pyramidal neurons in all cortical areas via activation of an apamin-sensitive SK-type calcium-activated potassium conductance. Cholinergic inhibition was most robust in prefrontal layer 5 neurons, where it relies on the same signal transduction mechanism (M1-like receptors, IP(3)-dependent calcium release, and SK-channels) as exists in somatosensory pyramidal neurons. Pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 were less responsive to ACh, but substantial apamin-sensitive inhibitory responses occurred in deep layer 3 neurons of the visual cortex. ACh was only inhibitory when presented near the somata of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where repetitive ACh applications generated discrete inhibitory events at frequencies of up to approximately 0.5 Hz. Fast-spiking (FS) nonpyramidal neurons in all cortical areas were unresponsive to ACh. When applied to non-FS interneurons in layers 2/3 and 5, ACh generated mecamylamine-sensitive nicotinic responses (38{\%} of cells), apamin-insensitive hyperpolarizing responses, with or without initial nicotinic depolarization (7{\%} of neurons), or no response at all (55{\%} of cells). Responses in interneurons were similar across cortical layers and regions but were correlated with cellular physiology and the expression of biochemical markers associated with different classes of nonpyramidal neurons. Finally, ACh generated nicotinic responses in all layer 1 neurons tested. These data demonstrate that phasic cholinergic input can directly inhibit projection neurons throughout the cortex while sculpting intracortical processing, especially in superficial layers.},

abstract = {GABAergic interneurons play important roles in cortical circuit development. However, there are multiple populations of interneurons and their respective developmental contributions remain poorly explored. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its interneuron-specific receptor ERBB4 are critical genes for interneuron maturation. Using a conditional ErbB4 deletion, we tested the role of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons in the postnatal maturation of cortical circuits in vivo. ErbB4 removal from VIP interneurons during development leads to changes in their activity, along with severe dysregulation of cortical temporal organization and state dependence. These alterations emerge during adolescence, and mature animals in which VIP interneurons lack ErbB4 exhibit reduced cortical responses to sensory stimuli and impaired sensory learning. Our data support a key role for VIP interneurons in cortical circuit development and suggest a possible contribution to pathophysiology in neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings provide a new perspective on the role of GABAergic interneuron diversity in cortical development. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Dendritic spines appear and disappear in an experience-dependent manner. Although some new spines have been shown to contain synapses, little is known about the relationship between spine addition and synapse formation, the relative time course of these events, or whether they are coupled to de novo growth of axonal boutons. We imaged dendrites in barrel cortex of adult mice over 1 month, tracking gains and losses of spines. Using serial section electron microscopy, we analyzed the ultrastructure of spines and associated boutons. Spines reconstructed shortly after they appeared often lacked synapses, whereas spines that persisted for 4 d or more always had synapses. New spines had a large surface-to-volume ratio and preferentially contacted boutons with other synapses. In some instances, two new spines contacted the same axon. Our data show that spine growth precedes synapse formation and that new synapses form preferentially onto existing boutons. Most excitatory synapses in the cerebral cortex terminate on dendritic spines 1 . Spines are structurally heterogeneous, varying in volumes by more than a factor of 100. Spine volumes are proportional to the area of the postsynaptic density (PSD) 2 , AMPA receptor (AMPAR) content 3–5 , and the size of the presynapse 2 , suggesting that spine size is directly related to synaptic strength. Recent work has focused on dendritic spines as a possible substrate of circuit plasticity in the adult brain. Neural circuits are sculpted by spontaneous activity and sensory experience 6 . Functional rewiring in the adult brain may involve structural plasticity with synapse formation and elimination 7–12 . Long-term in vivo imaging in the neocortex has revealed that a subpopulation of spines appear and disappear, whereas other spines persist for months 10,13,14 . In the barrel cortex, the lifetime of dendritic spines can be modulated by changes in sensory experience by whisker trimming 10,15,16 . How does spine addition relate to synapse formation? In cultured preparations, spines can emerge in response to synaptic stimulation 17,18 associated with synapse formation 19 . In vivo imaging experiments followed by electron microscopy have revealed that some new spines are associated with synapses 10 . However, these experiments did not distinguish whether new spines grow from previously existing shaft synapses (Miller-Peters model) 20–22 or whether new spines grow to contact a local axon with de novo synapse formation (Filopodia model) 23 . It is also unclear whether new spines form synapses on new boutons or preferentially contact existing boutons 8,12,20 . Here we reconstructed imaged dendritic spines and the surrounding neuropil using serial section electron microscopy (ssEM). New spines that persisted for a few days always had synapses. An analysis of the connectivity and geometry of axons and dendrites in the vicinity of new spines revealed that spine growth is followed by synapse formation. New spines preferentially formed synapses on multisynapse boutons, indicating that synapse formation does not correspond in a one-to-one fashion to the addition of axonal boutons.},

abstract = {Neurons can engage in synchronized oscillatory activity in the gamma-frequency range when responding to sensory stimuli. Both the oscillatory patterning and the synchronization of responses are enhanced with arousal and attention or when the electroencephalogram is activated by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Here we show with intracortical application of cholinergic antagonists that the enhancement of gamma oscillations and response synchronization is mediated by acetylcholine and muscarinic receptors. We demonstrate further that coapplication of cholinergic agonists with synchrony-inducing light stimuli causes a lasting increase in the probability that the stimulated cells engage in gamma oscillations and response synchronization. These changes develop slowly over tens of minutes and then persist for many hours. Thus, cholinergic modulation plays a crucial role both in the fast, state-dependent facilitation of gamma oscillations and response synchronization and in use-dependent long-term modifications of cortical dynamics that favor synchronization of responses in the gamma-frequency range.},

abstract = {Dlx homeodomain transcription factors are essential during embryonic development  for the production of forebrain GABAergic interneurons. Here we show that Dlx1 is also required for regulating the functional longevity of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in the adult brain. We demonstrate preferential Dlx1 expression in a subset of cortical and hippocampal interneurons which, in postnatal Dlx1 mutants, show a time-dependent reduction in number. This reduction preferentially affects calretinin(+) (bipolar cells) and somatostatin(+) subtypes (for example, bitufted cells), whereas parvalbumin(+) subpopulations (basket cells and chandelier cells) seem to be unaffected. Cell transplantation analysis demonstrates that interneuron loss reflects cell-autonomous functions of Dlx1. The decrease in the number of interneurons was associated with a reduction of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current in neocortex and hippocampus in vitro and cortical dysrhythmia in vivo. Dlx1 mutant mice show generalized electrographic seizures and histological evidence of seizure-induced reorganization, linking the Dlx1 mutation to delayed-onset epilepsy associated with interneuron loss.},

abstract = {1. Unilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM), a source of cholinergic projection to the cerebral cortex, were produced by injection of kainic acid in the cat. The lesions caused a significant reduction in density of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive terminals in the visual cortex ipsilateral to the lesions. 2. In the primary visual cortex ipsilateral to the lesions [acetylcholine (ACh)-depleted cortex], about half of the cells had weak or undetectable visual responses, whereas in the contralateral visual cortex almost all the cells had normal responsivity. The response selectivity, such as orientation and direction selectivities, of cortical cells was not affected by the depletion of ACh. 3. The microionophoretic application of ACh to cells under observation facilitated visual responses in 83{\%} of the cells recorded from the ACh-depleted cortex, whereas it suppressed the responses in only 9{\%}. The application of a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, to cells in the ACh-depleted cortex was ineffective, suggesting no residual ACh activity. 4. The mean current required to induce facilitation in the cortex ipsilateral to the lesion was significantly smaller than that required in the contralateral cortex and the visual cortex of the normal cat, suggesting a supersensitivity of receptors mediating the effect or a reduction in catabolism of exogenous ACh in the ACh-depleted cortex. 5. More than half of the cells that had been unresponsive to visual stimuli became clearly responsive during the ACh application. The response magnitude of cortical cells, as a whole, increased to the same degree as that observed during the ACh application in the normal cat. 6. In addition to the decrease in the average response magnitude, there was a remarkable variability in responses of cells to motion of the slit from sweep to sweep in the ACh-depleted cortex. The application of ACh to cortical cells decreased the variability of responses and consequently made the responses much more consistent. 7. These results suggest that without ACh supplied from the nBM, most of the cortical neurons could not respond briskly and consistently to excitatory inputs and that exogenously applied ACh could reverse such an impairment of cortical neurons through intact or even supersensitive postsynaptic receptors.},

abstract = {Perforant fibers taking their origin in the entorhinal region of the pyri-form cortex of the mouse make synaptic connections with dendritic spines in the distal (with respect to the granular cells) two-thirds of the molecular layer of the fascia dentata. In electron micrograhs, prepared by freeze-substitution, the mean area of the spines in the proximal one-third of this layer, where no endings of perforant fibers are present, was compared with the mean area of the spines in the distal one-third. Such measurements were made in preparations in which the perforant fibers had been stimulated (at 30/sec, for 30 sec) and in unstimulated controls. In 11 control preparations, the mean area of the distal spines was 13{\%} larger than that of the proximal spines. However, in 14 preparations in which the perforant fibers had been stimulated, the mean area of the distal spines was 53{\%} larger than that of the proximal ones. This difference is statistically highly significant. The spine swelling was present 2 min after the end of stimulation and had not noticeably decreased after 60 min (the longest time investigated). The swelling of spines, resulting in a decrease of their length resistance and an increase of their length constant, is proposed as a mechanism of the long lasting potentiation observed in this monosynaptic pathway. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

We found that the membrane potential of all cell types became more depolarized and (with the exception of somatostatin-positive interneurons) less variable during locomotion. Cholinergic input was essential for maintaining the unimodal membrane potential distribution during immobility, whereas noradrenergic input was necessary for the tonic depolarization associated with locomotion.

We found that S1-projecting vM1 pyramidal neurons strongly recruited vasointestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, a subset of serotonin receptor-expressing interneurons. These VIP interneurons preferentially inhibited somatostatin-expressing interneurons, neurons that target the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells. Consistent with this vM1-mediated disinhibitory circuit, the activity of VIP interneurons in vivo increased and that of somatostatin interneurons decreased during whisking. These changes in firing rates during whisking depended on vM1 activity.

abstract = {A central challenge of the postgenomic era is to comprehensively characterize the cellular role of the ∼20,000 proteins encoded in the human genome. To systematically study protein function in a native cellular background, libraries of human cell lines expressing proteins tagged with a functional sequence at their endogenous loci would be very valuable. Here, using electroporation of Cas9 nuclease/single-guide RNA ribonucleoproteins and taking advantage of a split-GFP system, we describe a scalable method for the robust, scarless, and specific tagging of endogenous human genes with GFP. Our approach requires no molecular cloning and allows a large number of cell lines to be processed in parallel. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by targeting 48 human genes and show that the resulting GFP fluorescence correlates with protein expression levels. We next present how our protocols can be easily adapted for the tagging of a given target with GFP repeats, critically enabling the study of low-abundance proteins. Finally, we show that our GFP tagging approach allows the biochemical isolation of native protein complexes for proteomic studies. Taken together, our results pave the way for the large-scale generation of endogenously tagged human cell lines for the proteome-wide analysis of protein localization and interaction networks in a native cellular context.},

We performed an extensive functional characterization of the newly established VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP, ChAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP, Tph2-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP and Pvalb(H134R)-ChR2-EYFP BAC transgenic mouse lines and demonstrate the utility of these lines for precisely controlling action-potential firing of GABAergic, cholinergic, serotonergic and parvalbumin-expressing neuron subsets using blue light. This resource of cell type–specific ChR2(H134R) mouse lines will facilitate the precise mapping of neuronal connectivity and the dissection of the neural basis of behavior.},

abstract = {In the mammalian neocortex, an area typically receives inputs from, and projects to, dozens of other areas. Mechanisms are needed to flexibly route information to the right place at the right time, which we term ‘pathway gating'. For instance, a region in your brain that receives signals from both visual and auditory pathways may want to ‘gate in' the visual pathway while ‘gating out' the auditory pathway when you try to read a book surrounded by people in a noisy caf{\'{e}}. In this review, we marshall experimental and computational evidence in support of a circuit mechanism for flexible pathway gating realized by a disinhibitory motif. Moreover, recent work shows an increasing preponderance of this disinhibitory motif from sensory areas to association areas of the mammalian cortex. Pathway input gating is briefly compared with alternative or complementary gating mechanisms. Predictions and open questions for future research on this puzzle about the complex brain system will be discussed.},

abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex are morphologically and physiologically extremely heterogeneous. This greatly interferes with an understanding of their functions. Progress has been made by classifying these neurons with the aid of molecular markers, e.g., neuropeptides or calcium-binding proteins, which are reliably expressed by certain subpopulations. We have used this approach to demonstrate an output of a subpopulation of cortical interneurons which express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). By double immunostaining and correlated light and electron microscopy, we show that calbindin (CB)-containing interneurons located in layers II-VI of rat barrel cortex are targets of symmetric VIP-immunoreactive synapses. All CB-immunoreactive interneurons showed numerous contacts of VIP boutons on proximal and distal dendritic segments. A great majority of CB-immunoreactive interneurons (214/222) displayed such close appositions with VIP boutons on their soma as well. Quantification revealed that the number of VIP-immunoreactive boutons on CB-immunoreactive somata and dendrites of specified order is comparable for the different cortical layers. In conclusion, all calbindin-containing cortical interneurons seem to be under direct influence of other GABAergic interneurons expressing the peptide VIP. An indirect functional consequence of this may be disinhibition of pyramidal cells, which are considered the major target of calbindin interneurons. However, since the examined types of interneurons are intricately embedded in networks of yet different interneurons, the outcome of these multiple inhibitory interactions is likely to be less simplistic. It may be related to the timing of pyramidal cell discharge within and across layers of cortical columns.},

Cholinergic or muscarinic agonists indeed induced GABAergic postsynaptic currents in pyramidal cells by exciting inhibitory interneurons that have recently been classified into several distinct subtypes on the basis of the physiological, chemical, and morphological criteria. Cholinergic effects on GABAergic cell subtypes were investigated of rat frontal cortex by in vitro whole cell recording with intracellular staining in frontal cortex of young rats. GABAergic cell subtypes were identified physiologically by firing responses to depolarizing current pulses and immunohistochemically as containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), or cholecystokinin (CCK). Carbachol (10 microM) or (+)-muscarine (3 microM) affected the activities of peptide-containing GABAergic cells with regular- or burst-spiking characteristics, but not of GABAergic cells with fast-spiking characteristics containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin or GABAergic cells with late-spiking characteristics. Somatostatin- or VIP-immunoreactive cells were depolarized with spike firing. CCK-immunoreactive cells were affected heterogeneously by cholinergic agonists. Larger CCK cells were hyperpolarized, followed by a slow depolarization, whereas smaller CCK cells were only depolarized. These results suggest that the excitability of cortical GABAergic cell subtypes is differentially regulated by acetylcholine. Differences in cholinergic responses suggest a distinct functional role of each GABAergic cell subtype.},

Recent data suggest that neurons expressing three markers, the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor 5HT3a (5HT3aR) account for nearly 100{\%} of neocortical interneurons. Interneurons expressing each of these markers have a different embryological origin. Each group includes several types of interneurons that differ in morphological and electrophysiological properties and likely have different functions in the cortical circuit. The PV group accounts for approximately 40{\%} of GABAergic neurons and includes fast spiking basket cells and chandelier cells. The SST group, which represents approximately 30{\%} of GABAergic neurons, includes the Martinotti cells and a set of neurons that specifically target layerIV. The 5HT3aR group, which also accounts for approximately 30{\%} of the total interneuronal population, is heterogeneous and includes all of the neurons that express the neuropeptide VIP, as well as an equally numerous subgroup of neurons that do not express VIP and includes neurogliaform cells. The universal modulation of these neurons by serotonin and acetylcholine via ionotropic receptors suggests that they might be involved in shaping cortical circuits during specific brain states and behavioral contexts.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Internal brain states affect sensory perception, cognition, and learning. Many neocortical areas exhibit changes in the pattern and synchrony of neuronal activity during quiet versus active behaviors. Active behaviors are typically associated with desynchronized cortical dynamics. Increased thalamic firing contributes importantly to desynchronize mouse barrel cortex during active whisker sensing. However, a whisking-related cortical state change persists after thalamic inactivation, which is mediated at least in part by acetylcholine, as we show here by using whole-cell recordings, local pharmacology, axonal calcium imaging, and optogenetic stimulation. During whisking, we find prominent cholinergic signals in the barrel cortex, which suppress spontaneous cortical activity. The desynchronized state of barrel cortex during whisking is therefore driven by at least two distinct signals with opposing functions: increased thalamic activity driving glutamatergic excitation of the cortex and increased cholinergic input suppressing spontaneous cortical activity. Eggermann etal. now find that the desynchronized state of the barrel cortex during active whisker sensing is accompanied by increased cholinergic input, which suppresses slow spontaneous cortical activity in excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons.},

abstract = {This study has used dense reconstructions from serial EM images to compare the neuropil ultrastructure and connectivity of aged and adult mice. The analysis used models of axons, dendrites, and their synaptic connections, reconstructed from volumes of neuropil imaged in layer 1 of the somatosensory cortex. This shows the changes to neuropil structure that accompany a general loss of synapses in a well-defined brain region. The loss of excitatory synapses was balanced by an increase in their size such that the total amount of synaptic surface, per unit length of axon, and per unit volume of neuropil, stayed the same. There was also a greater reduction of inhibitory synapses than excitatory, particularly those found on dendritic spines, resulting in an increase in the excitatory/inhibitory balance. The close correlations, that exist in young and adult neurons, between spine volume, bouton volume, synaptic size, and docked vesicle numbers are all preserved during aging. These comparisons display features that indicate a reduced plasticity of cortical circuits, with fewer, more transient, connections, but nevertheless an enhancement of the remaining connectivity that compensates for a generalized synapse loss.},

abstract = {gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons of neocortex consist of many subgroups with extremely heterogeneous morphological, physiological and molecular properties. To explore the putative effect of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunopositive (VIP +) neurons on neocortical circuitry, the number and distribution of VIP + boutons were analysed on somatodendritic domains of 272 parvalbumin immunopositive (PV +) 3D-reconstructed neurons. The synaptic nature of 91{\%} of somatic and 76{\%} of dendritic contacts was verified by electron microscopy. The target PV + neurons were separated in two significantly different groups by means of cluster analysis. The first group (Cluster 1, 26{\%}) received on average five times more VIP + synapses than those of the second group. The second group (Cluster 2, 74{\%}) contained cells that were poorly innervated by VIP + boutons or did not have either somatic or dendritic or any VIP innervation at all. The cells of Cluster 1 had a soma size and total dendritic length significantly smaller than that of Cluster 2, however, they received three times more dendritic synapses, which resulted in a five times higher VIP + synaptic density on dendrites. Our results showed that although most of the PV + cells are innervated by VIP + boutons at a varying degree, some 6{\%} of PV + cells received no input from VIP + interneurons. This suggests a refined morphological basis to influence the majority of the PV + interneurons, which are very effectively controlling pyramidal cell firing. Together with metabolic and neuromodulatory effects of VIP, this would probably result in an enhanced responsiveness of the latter cell type to tactile stimuli.},

abstract = {The cortical microcircuit seems to be a stereotyped unit that has been replicated and adapted to serve specific computational functions in different regions of the neocortex. An important element of this microcircuit is the wide variety of interneurons, most of which are inhibitory. Interneurons share several common features, but also show considerable diversity.Morphologically, interneurons can be divided into several groups: basket cells (large, small or nest basket cells); chandelier cells; Martinotti cells; bipolar cells; double bouquet cells; bitufted cells; neurogliaform cells; and layer I interneurons. However, the morphology of an interneuron does not define it; within a given morphological type, interneurons can show widely varying electrical or molecular properties.Interneurons can also be divided according to their steady-state or initial responses to stimuli. The main divisions are accommodating, non-accommodating, stuttering, irregular spiking and bursting, and each of these types is subdivided into three classes depending on the characteristics of the initial firing pattern (delayed, bursting or classical). These response types are useful markers, regardless of whether they define discrete classes (as opposed to a continuum).This electrical diversity arises from active properties (ion-channel combinations) and passive properties (the morphology of the neuron). The ion-channel genes that are expressed by an interneuron correlate with its electrophysiological properties. Ion-channel expression seems to fall into three clusters, which map around the three calcium-binding proteins (parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin) that are expressed in separate populations of interneuron.Other markers that can be used to define interneurons include neuropeptides. Although no one neuropeptide defines a specific interneuron type, some interneuron types tend to express specific combinations of neuropeptides.Excitatory synapses formed by pyramidal neurons onto inhibitory interneurons differ from those formed onto excitatory neurons in terms of receptor subtypes and facilitation. In return, interneurons make inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons that are targeted to specific cellular domains (the dendrites, cell body or axon). Interneurons also receive inhibitory synapses from other interneurons. However, such connections seem to be sparse.The diversity of interneurons might be required to achieve a balance between inhibition and excitation in the neocortex. It is not yet clear whether this diversity represents a continuum or distinct classes of interneuron, although anatomical classes seem to be clear. Gene-expression studies should help to clarify this issue.},

@article{Levinson2007,
abstract = {Objective: 
Neuroanatomic evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have impaired cortical inhibition (CI). However, there is little in vivo neurophysiological evidence supporting the occurrence of such impairments in this disorder. Using 3 transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms, known as short-interval CI (SICI), cortical silent period (SP), and interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), the authors measured inhibition in the motor cortex.
Method:
Fifteen patients with BD and 15 healthy subjects were enrolled. Short-interval CI involves stimulating with a subthreshold pulse a few milliseconds before a suprathreshold pulse, thereby inhibiting the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) produced by the suprathreshold pulse. In the SP paradigm, inhibition is reflected by the SP duration (ie, the duration of electromyographic activity cessation following a transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced MEP). Interhemispheric inhibition involves a subthreshold conditioning stimulus applied to the right motor cortex several milliseconds before a suprathreshold test stimulus is applied to the left motor cortex which inhibits the size of the MEP produced by the test stimulus by 50{\%} to 75{\%}.
Results:
Patients with BD demonstrated deficits in all 3 paradigms: SICI (F1,28 = 5.55, P = 0.03; Cohen d = 0.86), SP (F1,28 = 5.24, P = 0.03; Cohen d = 0.84), and IHI (F1,28 = 3.41, P = 0.02; Cohen d = 0.77) compared with healthy volunteers with a large effect size.
Conclusions:
Our study supports the hypothesis that CI is decreased in BD. Further understanding of the neurophysiology of such deficiencies may help to elucidate future treatment options.},

Acetylcholine also shows striking modulatory influences on the cellular physiology of hippocampal and cortical neurons. Modeling of neural circuits provides a framework for understanding how the cognitive functions may arise from the influence of acetylcholine on neural and network dynamics. We review the influences of cholinergic manipulations on behavioral performance in working memory, attention, episodic memory, and spatial memory tasks, the physiological effects of acetylcholine on neural and circuit dynamics, and the computational models that provide insight into the functional relationships between the physiology and behavior. Specifically, we discuss the important role of acetylcholine in governing mechanisms of active maintenance in working memory tasks and in regulating network dynamics important for effective processing of stimuli in attention and episodic memory tasks. We also propose that theta rhythm plays a crucial role as an intermediary between the physiological influences of acetylcholine and behavior in episodic and spatial memory tasks. We conclude with a synthesis of the existing modeling work and highlight future directions that are likely to be rewarding given the existing state of the literature for both empiricists and modelers.},

abstract = {In the mammalian neocortex, the EEG reflects the state of behavioral arousal. The EEG undergoes a transformation, known as activation, during the transition from sleep to waking. Abundant evidence indicates the involvement of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in EEG activation; however, the cellular basis of this involvement remains unclear. We have used electrophysiological techniques with in vivo and in vitro preparations to demonstrate actions of endogenous ACh on neurons in auditory neocortex. In vivo stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB), a primary source of neocortical ACh, (1) elicited EEG activation via cortical muscarinic receptors, (2) depolarized cortical neurons, and (3) produced a change in subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations from large-amplitude, slow (1-5 Hz) oscillations to low-amplitude, fast (20-40 Hz) oscillations. The NB-mediated change in pattern of membrane potential fluctuations resulted in a shift of spike discharge pattern from phasic to tonic. Stimulation of afferents in the in vitro neocortex elicited cholinergic actions on putative layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Acting via muscarinic receptors, endogenous ACh (1) reduced slow, rhythmic burst discharge and facilitated higher-frequency, single-spike discharge in burst-generating neurons, and (2) facilitated the appearance and magnitude of intrinsic membrane potential oscillations. These in vivo and in vitro observations suggest that neocortical activation results from muscarinic modulation of intrinsic neural oscillations and firing modes. Rhythmic-bursting pyramidal neurons in layer 5 may act as cortical pacemakers; if so, then modifying their discharge characteristics could alter local cortical networks. Larger, intercortical networks could also be modified, due to the widespread projections of NB neurons. Thus, NB cholinergic neurons may play a critical role in producing different states of neocortical function.},

We then mimic reward timing in vitro by pairing white matter stimulation with muscarinic receptor activation at a fixed interval and show that this protocol results in the prolongation of electrically evoked spike train durations out to the conditioned interval. Together, these data suggest that V1 possesses the circuitry and plasticity to support reward time prediction learning and the cholinergic system serves as an important reinforcement signal which, in vivo, conveys to the cortex the outcome of behavior},

abstract = {During postnatal development, altered sensory experience triggers the rapid reorganization of neuronal responses and connections in sensory neocortex. This experience-dependent plasticity is disrupted by reductions of intracortical inhibition. Little is known about how the responses of inhibitory cells themselves change during plasticity. We investigated the time course of inhibitory cell plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex by using functional two-photon microscopy with single-cell resolution and genetic identification of cell type. Initially, local inhibitory and excitatory cells had similar binocular visual response properties, both favoring the contralateral eye. After 2 days of monocular visual deprivation, excitatory cell responses shifted to favor the open eye, whereas inhibitory cells continued to respond more strongly to the deprived eye. By 4 days of deprivation, inhibitory cell responses shifted to match the faster changes in their excitatory counterparts. These findings reveal a dramatic delay in inhibitory cell plasticity. A minimal linear model reveals that the delay in inhibitory cell plasticity potently accelerates Hebbian plasticity in neighboring excitatory neurons. These findings offer a network-level explanation as to how inhibition regulates the experience-dependent plasticity of neocortex.},

The cholinergic and cholinoceptive areas, both in central and peripheral nervous system, have been well documented. Acetylcholine has been described to control, during embryogenesis, cell proliferation as well as neuron and glial cell survival and differentiation. In the adult, ACh and its receptors are distributed in the nervous system and in the other tissues. More recently, new physiological roles in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues have been proposed for ACh as well as its possible involvement in different pathologies. Altered levels of ACh or modified receptors expression and function, in selected areas of the nervous system, have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington as well as in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Frequently own cognitive, behavioral and motor disabilities that characterize these pathologies are correlated to cholinergic circuit dysfunction. Moreover the involvement of ACh as modulator of the inflammation, in and out of the nervous system, has suggested that its altered functions might represent an additional pathogenetic mechanism negatively influencing the disease outcome as recently suggested in multiple sclerosis. The present review will focus on identifying the cause/effect relationship that may explain the cholinergic dysfunction in several nervous system disorders.

How the cholinergic input modulates the activity of different subtypes of cortical neurons remains unclear. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in layers 1 and 2/3 of mouse visual cortex, we show that electrical stimulation of the BF bi-directionally modulates the activity of excitatory neurons as well as several subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. While glutamatergic activity contributed to the activation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the contribution of acetylcholine (ACh) was more complex. Excitatory and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons were activated through muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) at low levels of cortical desynchronization and suppressed through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) when cortical desynchronization was strong. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive (VIP+) and layer 1 interneurons were preferentially activated through nAChRs during strong cortical desynchronization. Thus, cholinergic input from the BF causes a significant shift in the relative activity levels of different subtypes of cortical neurons at increasing levels of cortical desynchronization.},

Most recent studies in the neocortex have suggested that acetylcholine acts non-synaptically, however in the present study we provide ultrastructural evidence that suggests synaptic mechanisms prevail. This conclusion is based upon our ultrastructural observations that cholinergic boutons – as revealed by immunoreactivity for the specific cholinergic market, vesicular acetylcholine transporter – establish a high percentage of classical synapses in layer V of the rat parietal cortex. Furthermore, the combination of this approach with the intracellular labeling of large pyramidal neurons on slice preparations revealed significant incidences of cholinergic contacts abutting preferentially on dendritic shafts. Finally, we have gathered information suggesting that cholinergic boutons undergo atrophy with aging which could be related to the well-known cholinergic and cognitive decline. These results illustrate that the cholinergic terminations in the neocortex establish proper synaptic connections and that they experience important age-dependent atrophy."

Although nicotinic agonists evoke inward currents and Ca2+ transients in stratum radiatum interneurons, the role of endogenous ACh in modulating synaptic integration by interneurons is incompletely understood. Many cholinergic axonal varicosities do not have postsynaptic specializations, but α7 receptors frequently occur close to synaptic GABAA receptors. These observations raise the possibility that α7 nicotinic receptors activated by ACh released from cholinergic axons modulate GABAergic transmission in interneurons. We show that agonists of α7 receptors profoundly depress GABAergic IPSCs recorded in stratum radiatum interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This depression is accompanied by a small increase in GABA release. α7 nicotinic receptor agonists also depress GABA- or muscimol-evoked currents in interneurons, indicating that the major effect is a postsynaptic modulation of GABAA receptors. The depression of GABA-evoked currents is abolished by chelating Ca2+ in the recorded interneuron and attenuated by inhibitors of PKC. We also show that stimuli designed to release endogenous ACh from cholinergic axons evoke an α7 receptor-dependent heterosynaptic depression of GABAergic IPSCs in interneurons. This heterosynaptic modulation is amplified by blocking cholinesterases. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which cholinergic neurons modulate information processing in the hippocampus.},

abstract = {Tau pathology in AD spreads in a hierarchical pattern, whereby it first appears in the entorhinal cortex, then spreads to the hippocampus and later to the surrounding areas. Based on this sequential appearance, AD can be classified into six stages (``Braak stages''). The mechanisms and agents underlying the progression of Tau pathology are a matter of debate. Emerging evidence indicates that the propagation of Tau pathology may be due to the transmission of Tau protein, but the underlying pathways and Tau species are not well understood. In this study we investigated the question of Tau spreading via small extracellular vesicles called exosomes.},

abstract = {From early embryonic development to adulthood, GABA release participates in the construction of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission is a protracted process which takes place in discrete steps and results from the dynamic interaction between developmentally directed gene expression and brain activity. During the course of development, GABAergic interneurons contribute to key aspects of the functional maturation of the cortex in different ways, from exerting a trophic role to pacing immature neural networks. In this review, we provide an overview of the maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission and discuss the role of GABAergic interneurons in cortical wiring, plasticity, and network activity during pre- and postnatal development. We also discuss psychiatric diseases that may be considered at least in part developmental disorders of the GABAergic system},

abstract = {Whisker movement is somatotopically represented in rodent neocortex by electrical activity in clearly defined barrels, which can be visualized in living brain slices. The functional architecture of this part of the cortex can thus be mapped in vitro with respect to its physiological input and compared with its anatomical architecture. The spatial extent of excitation was measured at high temporal resolution by imaging optical signals from voltage-sensitive dye evoked by stimulation of individual barrels in layer 4. The optical signals correlated closely with subthreshold EPSPs recorded simultaneously from excitatory neurons in layer 4 and layer 2/3, respectively. Excitation was initially ({\textless}2 msec) limited to the stimulated barrel and subsequently ({\textgreater}3 msec) spread in a columnar manner into layer 2/3 and then subsided in both layers after approximately 50 msec. The lateral extent of the response was limited to the cortical column defined structurally by the barrel in layer 4. Two experimental interventions increased the spread of excitation. First, blocking GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition caused excitation to spread laterally throughout wide regions of layer 2/3 and layer 5 but not into neighboring barrels, suggesting that the local excitatory connections within layer 4 are restricted to single barrels and that inhibitory neurons control spread in supragranular and infragranular layers. Second, NMDA receptor-dependent increase of the spread of excitation was induced by pairing repetitive stimulation of a barrel column with coincident stimulation of layer 2/3 in a neighboring column. Such plasticity in the spatial extent of excitation in a barrel column could underlie changes in cortical map structure induced by alterations of sensory experience.},

abstract = {The role of interneurons in neurovascular coupling was investigated by patch-clamp recordings in acute rat cortical slices, followed by single-cell reverse transcriptase-multiplex PCR (RT-mPCR) and confocal observation of biocytin-filled neurons, laminin-stained microvessels, and immunodetection of their afferents by vasoactive subcortical cholinergic (ACh) and serotonergic (5-HT) pathways. The evoked firing of single interneurons in whole-cell recordings was sufficient to either dilate or constrict neighboring microvessels. Identification of vasomotor interneurons by single-cell RT-mPCR revealed expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in interneurons inducing dilatation and somatostatin (SOM) in those eliciting contraction. Constrictions appeared spatially restricted, maximal at the level of neurite apposition, and were associated with contraction of surrounding smooth muscle cells, providing the first evidence for neural regulation of vascular sphincters. Direct perfusion of VIP and NO donor onto the slices dilated microvessels, whereas neuropeptide Y (NPY) and SOM induced vasoconstriction. RT-PCR analyses revealed expression of specific subtypes of neuropeptide receptors in smooth muscle cells from intracortical microvessels, compatible with the vasomotor responses they elicited. By triple and quadruple immunofluorescence, the identified vasomotor interneurons established contacts with local microvessels and received, albeit to a different extent depending on interneuron subtypes, somatic and dendritic afferents from ACh and 5-HT pathways. Our results demonstrate the ability of specific subsets of cortical GABA interneurons to transmute neuronal signals into vascular responses and further suggest that they could act as local integrators of neurovascular coupling for subcortical vasoactive pathways.},

abstract = "Recent immunoelectron microscopic studies have revealed a low frequency of synaptic membrane differentiations on ACh (ChAT-immunostained) axon terminals (boutons or varicosities) in adult rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and neostriatum, suggesting that, besides synaptic transmission, diffuse transmission by ACh prevails in many regions of the CNS. Cytological analysis of the immediate microenvironment of these ACh terminals, as well as currently available immunocytochemical data on the cellular and subcellular distribution of ACh receptors, is congruent with this view. At least in brain regions densely innervated by ACh neurons, a further aspect of the diffuse transmission paradigm is envisaged: the existence of an ambient level of ACh in the extracellular space, to which all tissue elements would be permanently exposed. Recent experimental data on the various molecular forms of AChE and their presumptive role at the neuromuscular junction support this hypothesis. As in the peripheral nervous system, degradation of ACh by the prevalent G4 form of AChE in the CNS would primarily serve to keep the extrasynaptic, ambient level of ACh within physiological limits, rather than totally eliminate ACh from synaptic clefts. Long-lasting and widespread electrophysiological effects imputable to ACh in the CNS might be explained in this manner. The notions of diffuse transmission and of an ambient level of ACh in the CNS could also be of clinical relevance, in accounting for the production and nature of certain cholinergic deficits and the efficacy of substitution therapies."

First, brain tissue expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) is chemically fixed. Then, an immunocytochemistry process is used to render the fluorescent protein electron dense so that it can first be located using light microscopy and then serial thin-sectioned for EM so that the ultrastructure of specific parts of neurites can be analyzed in three dimensions. Patterns of blood vessels observed in the live brain are used to locate the previously imaged neurons. The method described here allows for a complete three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction to be made of the imaged structures from serial electron micrographs.},

Notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. The neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. In vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive neurons in mouse V1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. Optogenetic activation of VIP neurons increased V1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of VIP neurons abolished the enhancement of V1 responses by locomotion. These findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state.},

abstract = {Lysosomes have traditionally been viewed as degradative organelles, although a growing body of evidence suggests that they can function as Ca2+ stores. Here we examined the function of these stores in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We found that back-propagating action potentials (bpAPs) could elicit Ca2+ release from lysosomes in the dendrites. This Ca2+ release triggered the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of Cathepsin B. Cathepsin B increased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), an enzyme involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and synaptic plasticity. Inhibition of either lysosomal Ca2+ signaling or Cathepsin B release prevented the maintenance of dendritic spine growth induced by Hebbian activity. This impairment could be rescued by exogenous application of active MMP-9. Our findings suggest that activity-dependent exocytosis of Cathepsin B from lysosomes regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines by triggering MMP-9 activation and ECM remodelling.},

abstract = {A highly diverse population of neocortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons has  been implicated in multiple functions in information processing within cortical circuits. The diversity of cortical interneurons is determined during development and primarily depends on their embryonic origins either from the medial (MGE) or the caudal (CGE) ganglionic eminences. Although MGE-derived parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons are well characterized, less is known about the other types of cortical GABAergic interneurons, especially those of CGE lineage, because of the lack of specific neuronal markers for these interneuron subtypes. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse line, we show that, in the somatosensory cortex of the mouse, the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 3A (5-HT(3A)) receptor, the only ionotropic serotonergic receptor, is expressed in most, if not all, neocortical GABAergic interneurons that do not express PV or SST. Genetic fate mapping and neurochemical profile demonstrate that 5-HT(3A)R-expressing neurons include the entire spectrum of CGE-derived interneurons. We report that, in addition to serotonergic responsiveness via 5-HT(3A)Rs, acetylcholine also depolarizes 5-HT(3A)R-expressing neurons via nicotinic receptors. 5-HT(3A)R-expressing neurons in thalamocortical (TC) recipient areas receive weak but direct monosynaptic inputs from the thalamus. TC input depolarizes a subset of TC-recipient 5-HT(3A)R neurons as strongly as fast-spiking cells, in part because of their high input resistance. Hence, fast modulation of serotonergic and cholinergic transmission may influence cortical activity through an enhancement of GABAergic synaptic transmission from 5-HT(3A)R-expressing neurons during sensory process depending on different behavioral states.},

One putative role for LTD is in the reduction of cortical responsiveness to behaviorally irrelevant or unused sensory stimuli, a common feature of map plasticity. Here we show that whisker deprivation, a manipulation that drives map plasticity in rat somatosensory cortex (S1), induces detectable LTD-like depression at intracortical excitatory synapses between cortical layer 4 (L4) and L2/3 pyramidal neurons. This synaptic depression occluded further LTD, enhanced LTP, was column specific, and was driven in part by competition between active and inactive whiskers. The synaptic locus of LTD and these properties suggest that LTD underlies the reduction of cortical responses to deprived whiskers, a major component of S1 map plasticity.},

Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state.},

abstract = {Despite striking advances in functional brain imaging, the cellular and molecular  mechanisms that underlie the signals detected by these techniques are still largely unknown. The basic physiological principle of functional imaging is represented by the tight coupling existing between neuronal activity and the associated local increase in both blood flow and energy metabolism. Positron emission tomography (PET) signals detect blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose use associated with neuronal activity; the degree of blood oxygenation is currently thought to contribute to the signal detected with functional magnetic resonance imaging, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) identifies the spatio-temporal pattern of the activity-dependent appearance of certain metabolic intermediates such as glucose or lactate. Recent studies, including those of neurotransmitter-regulated metabolic fluxes in purified preparations and analyses of the cellular localization of enzymes and transporters involved in energy metabolism, as well as in vivo microdialysis and MRS approaches have identified the neurotransmitter glutamate and astrocytes, a specific type of glial cell, as pivotal elements in the coupling of synaptic activity with energy metabolism. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to sense increases in synaptic activity and to couple them with energy metabolism. Indeed they possess specialized processes that cover the surface of intraparenchymal capillaries, suggesting that astrocytes may be a likely site of prevalent glucose uptake. Other astrocyte processes are wrapped around synaptic contacts which possess receptors and reuptake sites for neurotransmitters. Glutamate stimulates glucose uptake into astrocytes. This effect is mediated by specific glutamate transporters present on these cells. The activity of these transporters, which is tightly coupled to the synaptic release of glutamate and operates the clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space, is driven by the electrochemical gradient of Na+. This Na(+)-dependent uptake of glutamate into astrocytes triggers a cascade of molecular events involving the Na+/K(+)-ATPase leading to the glycolytic processing of glucose and the release of lactate by astrocytes. The stoichiometry of this process is such that for one glutamate molecule taken up with three Na+ ions, one glucose molecule enters an astrocyte, two ATP molecules are produced through aerobic glycolysis and two lactate molecules are released. Within the astrocyte, one ATP molecule fuels one 'turn of the pump' while the other provides the energy needed to convert glutamate to glutamine by glutamine synthase. Evidence has been accumulated from structural as well as functional studies indicating that, under aerobic conditions, lactate may be the preferred energy substrate of activated neurons. Indeed, in the presence of oxygen, lactate is converted to pyruvate, which can be processed through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the associated oxidative phosphorylation, to yield 17 ATP molecules per lactate molecule. These data suggest that during activation the brain may transiently resort to aerobic glycolysis occurring in astrocytes, followed by the oxidation of lactate by neurons. The proposed model provides a direct mechanism to couple synaptic activity with glucose use and is consistent with the notion that the signals detected during physiological activation with 18F-deoxyglucose (DG)-PET may reflect predominantly uptake of the tracer into astrocytes. This conclusion does not question the validity of the 2-DG-based techniques, rather it provides a cellular and molecular basis for these functional brain imaging techniques.},

abstract = {The geometries of axons, dendrites and their synaptic connections provide important information about their functional properties. These can be collected directly from measurements made on serial electron microscopy images. However, manual and automated segmentation methods can also yield large and accurate models of neuronal architecture from which morphometric data can be gathered in 3D space. This technical paper presents a series of software tools, operating in the Blender open source software, for the quantitative analysis of axons and their synaptic connections. These allow the user to annotate serial EM images to generate models of different cellular structures or to make measurements of models generated in other software. The paper explains how the tools can measure the cross-sectional surface area at regular intervals along the length of an axon, and the amount of contact with other cellular elements in the surrounding neuropil, as well as the density of organelles, such as vesicles and mitochondria, that it contains. Nearest distance measurements, in 3D space, can also be made between any features. This provides many capabilities such as the detection of boutons and the evaluation of different vesicle pool sizes, allowing users to comprehensively describe many aspects of axonal morphology and connectivity.},

abstract = {Cortical inhibitory neurons contact each other to form a network of inhibitory synaptic connections. Our knowledge of the connectivity pattern underlying this inhibitory network is, however, still incomplete. Here we describe a simple and complementary interaction scheme between three large, molecularly distinct interneuron populations in mouse visual cortex: parvalbumin-expressing interneurons strongly inhibit one another but provide little inhibition to other populations. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing interneurons avoid inhibiting one another yet strongly inhibit all other populations. Finally, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons preferentially inhibit somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This scheme occurs in supragranular and infragranular layers, suggesting that inhibitory networks operate similarly at the input and output of the visual cortex. Thus, as the specificity of connections between excitatory neurons forms the basis for the cortical canonical circuit, the scheme described here outlines a standard connectivity pattern among cortical inhibitory neurons.},

abstract = {The activity of single neurons in the basal forebrain was recorded in the freely-moving rat with moveable fine-wire electrodes. Neural activity was observed while the water-deprived male rat was exposed to three different types of motivating stimuli that elicit locomotion in a running wheel: an estrous female rat; a drinking tube containing water; and grasping and lifting by the experimenter. The neural activity was also observed when the subject was presented with standardized sensory tests and during single pulse stimulation of other brain structures. A majority of the 76 neurons recorded in the forebrain changed their firing rate during orienting and/or locomotion in general (23 neurons) or during behavior related to only one of the specific motivational contexts: the conspecific female (4 neurons); water (7 neurons); or grasp by the experimenter (8 neurons). Whereas the neurons related to orienting and/or locomotion in general were scattered through various brain structures, those neurons related to specific motivational contexts were concentrated in specific areas: the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the medial preoptic area (conspecific female); lateral septum (water); and lateral preoptic area (water and grasp). The present results, although based on relatively few neurons, are consonant with results of research using other techniques. This indicates that analyses at the level of the single neuron promise to be useful for understanding the role of the basal forebrain in motivational systems.},

abstract = {Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), the causative agent of botulism, is acknowledged to be the most poisonous protein known. BoNT proteases disable synaptic vesicle exocytosis by cleaving their cytosolic SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) substrates. BoNT is a modular nanomachine: an N-terminal Zn(2+)-metalloprotease, which cleaves the SNAREs; a central helical protein-conducting channel, which chaperones the protease across endosomes; and a C-terminal receptor-binding module, consisting of two subdomains that determine target specificity by binding to a ganglioside and a protein receptor on the cell surface and triggering endocytosis. For BoNT, functional complexity emerges from its modular design and the tight interplay between its component modules--a partnership with consequences that surpass the simple sum of the individual component's action. BoNTs exploit this design at each step of the intoxication process, thereby achieving an exquisite toxicity. This review summarizes current knowledge on the structure of individual modules and presents mechanistic insights into how this protein machine evolved to this level of sophistication. Understanding the design principles underpinning the function of such a dynamic modular protein remains a challenging task.},

abstract = {Early sensory experience instructs the maturation of neural circuitry in the cortex. This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that eye, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition mediates this process, but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP.},

abstract = {The adult brain continues to learn and can recover from injury, but the elements  and operation of the neural circuits responsible for this plasticity are not known. In previous work, we have shown that locomotion dramatically enhances neural activity in the visual cortex (V1) of the mouse (Niell and Stryker, 2010), identified the cortical circuit responsible for this enhancement (Fu et al., 2014), and shown that locomotion also dramatically enhances adult plasticity (Kaneko and Stryker, 2014). The circuit that is responsible for enhancing neural activity in the visual cortex contains both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SST) neurons (Fu et al., 2014). Here, we ask whether this VIP-SST circuit enhances plasticity directly, independent of locomotion and aerobic activity. Optogenetic activation or genetic blockade of this circuit reveals that it is both necessary and sufficient for rapidly increasing V1 cortical responses following manipulation of visual experience in adult mice. These findings reveal a disinhibitory circuit that regulates adult cortical plasticity.},

Sst interneuron subtypes, residing in different cortical layers and innervating complementary laminar domains, exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative weight of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (Vip) interneuron-mediated inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo activity.

Relating these features to other mammalian species and known molecular regulators of the mouse neocortex suggests how this developmental process could have emerged in evolution.},

abstract = {The discovery of light-inducible protein-protein interactions has allowed for the spatial and temporal control of a variety of biological processes. To be effective, a photodimerizer should have several characteristics: it should show a large change in binding affinity upon light stimulation, it should not cross-react with other molecules in the cell, and it should be easily used in a variety of organisms to recruit proteins of interest to each other. To create a switch that meets these criteria we have embedded the bacterial SsrA peptide in the C-terminal helix of a naturally occurring photoswitch, the light-oxygen-voltage 2 (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa. In the dark the SsrA peptide is sterically blocked from binding its natural binding partner, SspB. When activated with blue light, the C-terminal helix of the LOV2 domain undocks from the protein, allowing the SsrA peptide to bind SspB. Without optimization, the switch exhibited a twofold change in binding affinity for SspB with light stimulation. Here, we describe the use of computational protein design, phage display, and high-throughput binding assays to create an improved light inducible dimer (iLID) that changes its affinity for SspB by over 50-fold with light stimulation. A crystal structure of iLID shows a critical interaction between the surface of the LOV2 domain and a phenylalanine engineered to more tightly pin the SsrA peptide against the LOV2 domain in the dark. We demonstrate the functional utility of the switch through light-mediated subcellular localization in mammalian cell culture and reversible control of small GTPase signaling.},

How the cholinergic input modulates the activity of different subtypes of cortical neurons remains unclear. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in layers 1 and 2/3 of mouse visual cortex, we show that electrical stimulation of the BF bi-directionally modulates the activity of excitatory neurons as well as several subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. While glutamatergic activity contributed to the activation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the contribution of acetylcholine (ACh) was more complex. Excitatory and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons were activated through muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) at low levels of cortical desynchronization and suppressed through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) when cortical desynchronization was strong. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive (VIP+) and layer 1 interneurons were preferentially activated through nAChRs during strong cortical desynchronization. Thus, cholinergic input from the BF causes a significant shift in the relative activity levels of different subtypes of cortical neurons at increasing levels of cortical desynchronization.},

abstract = {1. Effects of microionophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) and its antagonists on neuronal responses to visual stimuli and to electrical stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus were studied in the cat striate cortex. 2. Responses elicited visually and electrically were facilitated by ACh in 74{\%} of the cells tested, whereas the responses were suppressed in 16{\%}. These ACh effects were blocked by a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, but not by a nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium, indicating that the ACh effects are mediated through muscarinic receptors. A single application of atropine suppressed visual responses of cells facilitated by ACh, whereas it enhanced those of cells inhibited by ACh, suggesting that endogenous ACh may tonically modulate visual responsivity of cortical neurons. 3. In most cells with the facilitatory ACh effect, responses with single spikes to the electrical stimulation became more consistent, often with double spikes, during the ACh application. The suppressive effects of ACh were noted most often in cells with a longer response latency to electrical stimulation of lateral geniculate nucleus. 4. In most of the facilitated cells the spontaneous activity remained null or very low during ACh application, in spite of marked enhancement of visual responses, suggesting that ACh may improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of cortical neuron activity. To confirm this suggestion, we calculated a S/S + N index by counting the total number of spikes in the responses (S) and that in peristimulus time histogram (S + N) and found that it was improved during the ACh application in about a half of the cells, whereas it became worse in about one-fifth. 5. In most of the facilitated cells, ACh enhanced visual responses not only to optimal but also to nonoptimal stimuli, resulting in no improvement or even worsening of the orientation selectivity. This was also the case in the selectivity of direction of stimulus movement. 6. The laminar location of the facilitated cells was biased toward layers V and VI of the cortex, although they also made up the majority in layers II + III and about half the tested cells in layers IVab and IVc. 7. In the light of recent understanding of cortical circuitry, these results suggest that the cholinergic innervation to cortical neurons may play a role in improvement of the S/N ratio of information processing in the striate cortex and in facilitation of sending processed informations to other visual centers.},

abstract = {Functional circuits in the adult neocortex adjust to novel sensory experience, but the underlying synaptic mechanisms remain unknown. Growth and retraction of dendritic spines with synapse formation and elimination could change brain circuits. In the apical tufts of layer 5B (L5B) pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex, a subset of dendritic spines appear and disappear over days, whereas most spines are persistent for months. Under baseline conditions, new spines are mostly transient and rarely survive for more than a week. Transient spines tend to be small, whereas persistent spines are usually large. Because most excitatory synapses in the cortex occur on spines, and because synapse size and the number of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are proportional to spine volume, the excitation of pyramidal neurons is probably driven through synapses on persistent spines. Here we test whether the generation and loss of persistent spines are enhanced by novel sensory experience. We repeatedly imaged dendritic spines for one month after trimming alternate whiskers, a paradigm that induces adaptive functional changes in neocortical circuits. Whisker trimming stabilized new spines and destabilized previously persistent spines. New-persistent spines always formed synapses. They were preferentially added on L5B neurons with complex apical tufts rather than simple tufts. Our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons. These synaptic changes probably underlie experience-dependent remodelling of specific neocortical circuits.},

@article{Restani2012,
abstract = {The striking differences between the clinical symptoms of tetanus and botulism have been ascribed to the different fate of the parental neurotoxins once internalised in motor neurons. Tetanus toxin (TeNT) is known to undergo transcytosis into inhibitory interneurons and block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, causing a spastic paralysis. In contrast, botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) block acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, therefore inducing a flaccid paralysis. Whilst overt experimental evidence supports the sorting of TeNT to the axonal retrograde transport pathway, recent findings challenge the established view that BoNT trafficking is restricted to the neuromuscular junction by highlighting central effects caused by these neurotoxins. These results suggest a more complex scenario whereby BoNTs also engage long-range trafficking mechanisms. However, the intracellular pathways underlying this process remain unclear. We sought to fill this gap by using primary motor neurons either in mass culture or differentiated in microfluidic devices to directly monitor the endocytosis and axonal transport of full length BoNT/A and BoNT/E and their recombinant binding fragments. We show that BoNT/A and BoNT/E are internalised by spinal cord motor neurons and undergo fast axonal retrograde transport. BoNT/A and BoNT/E are internalised in non-acidic axonal carriers that partially overlap with those containing TeNT, following a process that is largely independent of stimulated synaptic vesicle endo-exocytosis. Following intramuscular injection in vivo, BoNT/A and TeNT displayed central effects with a similar time course. Central actions paralleled the peripheral spastic paralysis for TeNT, but lagged behind the onset of flaccid paralysis for BoNT/A. These results suggest that the fast axonal retrograde transport compartment is composed of multifunctional trafficking organelles orchestrating the simultaneous transfer of diverse cargoes from nerve terminals to the soma, and represents a general gateway for the delivery of virulence factors and pathogens to the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen substantial progress in studying the structural and functional properties of GABAergic interneurons and their roles in the neuronal networks of barrel cortex. Although GABAergic interneurons represent only about 12{\%} of the total number of neocortical neurons, they are extremely diverse with respect to their structural and functional properties. It has become clear that barrel cortex interneurons not only serve the maintenance of an appropriate excitation/inhibition balance but also are directly involved in sensory processing. In this review we present different interneuron types and their axonal projection pattern framework in the context of the laminar and columnar organization of the barrel cortex. The main focus is here on the most prominent interneuron types, i.e. basket cells, chandelier cells, Martinotti cells, bipolar/bitufted cells and neurogliaform cells, but interneurons with more unusual axonal domains will also be mentioned. We describe their developmental origin, their classification with respect to molecular, morphological and intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties. Most importantly, we will highlight the most prominent circuit motifs these interneurons are involved in and in which way they serve feed-forward inhibition, feedback inhibition and disinhibition. Finally, this will be put into context to their functional roles in sensory signal perception and processing in the whisker system and beyond.},

abstract = {Attention exerts a strong influence over neuronal processing in cortical areas. It selectively increases firing rates and affects tuning properties, including changing receptive field locations and sizes. Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top-down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a central neurotransmitter critical for normal cognitive function. Here we show that transient muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation directly inhibits neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Using whole-cell and cell-attached recordings from neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate that transient activation of M1-type muscarinic receptors induces calcium release from IP3-sensitive intracellular calcium stores and subsequent activation of an apamin-sensitive, SK-type calcium-activated potassium conductance. ACh-induced hyperpolarizing responses were blocked by atropine and pirenzepine but not by methoctramine or GABA receptor antagonists (picrotoxin, SR 95531 [2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide], and CGP 55845 [(2S)-3-[[(15)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl](phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid]). Responses were associated with a 31 +/- 5{\%} increase in membrane conductance, had a reversal potential of -93 +/- 1 mV, and were eliminated after internal calcium chelation with BAPTA, blockade of IP3 receptors, or extracellular application of cadmium but not by sodium channel blockade with tetrodotoxin. Calcium-imaging experiments demonstrated that ACh-induced hyperpolarizing, but not depolarizing, responses were correlated with large increases in intracellular calcium. Surprisingly, transient increases in muscarinic receptor activation were capable of generating hyperpolarizing responses even during periods of tonic muscarinic activation sufficient to depolarize neurons to action potential threshold. Furthermore, eserine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor similar to those used therapeutically in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, disproportionately enhanced the excitatory actions of acetylcholine while reducing the ability of acetylcholine to generate inhibitory responses during repeated applications of ACh. These data demonstrate that acetylcholine can directly inhibit the output of neocortical pyramidal neurons.},

@article{Jiang2015,
abstract = {Despite the importance of the brain{\&}{\#}039;s neocortex, we still do not completely understand the diversity and functional connections of its cell types. Jiang et al. recorded, labeled, and classified over 1200 interneurons and more than 400 pyramidal neurons in the mature mouse visual cortex. Fifteen major classes of interneurons fell into three types: some connect to all neurons, some connect to other interneurons, and some form synapses with pyramidal neurons.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aac9462INTRODUCTIONThe intricate microcircuitry of the cerebral cortex is thought to be a critical substrate from which arise the impressive capabilities of the mammalian brain. Until now, our knowledge of the stereotypical connectivity in neocortical microcircuits has been pieced together from individual studies of the connectivity between small numbers of neuronal cell types. Here, we provide unbiased, large-scale profiling of neuronal cell types and connections to reveal the essential building blocks of the cortex and the principles governing their assembly into cortical circuits. Using advanced techniques for tissue slicing, multiple simultaneous whole-cell recording, and morphological reconstruction, we are able to provide a comprehensive view of the connectivity between diverse types of neurons, particularly among types of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) interneurons, in the adult animal.RATIONALEWe took advantage of a method for preparing high-quality slices of adult tissue and combined this technique with octuple simultaneous, whole-cell recordings followed by an improved staining method that allowed detailed recovery of axonal and dendritic arbor morphology. These data allowed us to perform a census of morphologically and electrophysiologically defined neuronal types (primarily GABAergic interneurons) in neocortical layers 1, 2/3, and 5 (L1, L23, and L5, respectively) and to observe their connectivity patterns in adult animals.RESULTSOur large-scale, comprehensive profiling of neocortical neurons differentiated 15 major types of interneurons, in addition to two lamina-defined types of pyramidal neurons (L23 and L5). Cortical interneurons comprise two types in L1 (eNGC and SBC-like), seven in L23 (L23MC, L23NGC, BTC, BPC, DBC, L23BC, and ChC), and six in L5 (L5MC, L5NGC, L5BC, SC, HEC, and DC) (see the figure). Each type has stereotypical electrophysiological properties and morphological features and can be differentiated from all others by cell type–specific axonal geometry and axonal projection patterns. Importantly, each type of neuron has its own characteristic input-output connectivity profile, connecting with other constituent neuronal types with varying degrees of specificity in postsynaptic targets, laminar location, and synaptic characteristics. Despite specific connection patterns for each cell type, we found that a small number of simple connectivity motifs are repeated across layers and cell types defining a canonical cortical microcircuit.CONCLUSIONOur comprehensive profiling of neuronal cell types and connections in adult neocortex provides the most complete wiring diagram of neocortical microcircuits to date. Compared with current genetic labels for cell class, which paint the cortex in broad strokes, our analysis of morphological and electrophysiological properties revealed new cell classes and allowed us to derive a small number of simple connectivity rules that were repeated across layers and cell types. This detailed blueprint of cortical wiring should aid efforts to identify specific circuit abnormalities in animal models of brain disease and may eventually provide a path toward the development of comprehensive circuit-based, cell type–specific interventions.

However, a complete census of the constituent cell types and their wiring diagram in mature neocortex remains elusive. By combining octuple whole-cell recordings with an optimized avidin-biotin-peroxidase staining technique, we carried out a morphological and electrophysiological census of neuronal types in layers 1, 2/3, and 5 of mature neocortex and mapped the connectivity between more than 11,000 pairs of identified neurons. We categorized 15 types of interneurons, and each exhibited a characteristic pattern of connectivity with other interneuron types and pyramidal cells. The essential connectivity structure of the neocortical microcircuit could be captured by only a few connectivity motifs.},

abstract = {For many years, scientists have used chemicals to preserve brain tissue to observe its fine structure using high power microscopes. Korogod et al. now show that these chemicals, or fixatives, cause the tissue to shrink, giving the false impression that the cells are tightly packed together. This has led to misinterpretations of how the brain is structured. For example, components such as the synapse, used by neurons to communicate with each other, are bathed in a watery environment, rather than being tightly enclosed by neighbouring cells as previously thought.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nElectron microscopy is the only imaging method that is able to see the detailed structure of the nervous system, including synaptic connections. The technique fires a beam of electrons through a sample held in a vacuum and creates images at a higher magnification than light microscopes. However, the electron beam and the vacuum damages live cells and tissues. Therefore, samples must be ‘fixed' to preserve them before they are imaged with these methods. However, the standard method for fixing brain tissue uses chemical ‘fixatives', even though these cause shrinkage, and distort the cells.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nKorogod et al. used an alternative method of fixation—freezing—to better preserve tiny pieces of mouse brain in their natural state. This was achieved with a technique called ‘high pressure freezing' that combines jets of liquid nitrogen with very high pressures to instantaneously preserve small samples without causing damage through the formation of ice crystals, or any shrinkage and distortion. Once frozen, the samples of mouse brain are encased in resin, and then imaged with the electron microscope. A comparison between the two preservation techniques showed that chemical fixatives remove the watery environment, or extracellular fluid, that surrounds the cells in the brain, squashing them together.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe synapses were surrounded by large amounts of extracellular fluid, but cryo fixation also revealed that these sites of communication between neurons also contained many more vesicles—the packets containing the chemicals that pass signals across the synapse. Another type of cell, the glial cell, that supports and helps to maintain neurons, was also strongly distorted by the chemical fixation. These were understood to tightly wrap around synapses, as well as blood vessels, but cryo fixation showed this to be less prominent.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis study illustrates that our understanding of how brain's cells are arranged has ignored the effects of the chemicals used to preserve them. Although cryo fixation is only able to preserve tiny samples, it reveals a truer picture of their natural structure, giving scientists a better understanding of how the brain works.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nDOI: [http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05793.002][1]$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.7554/eLife.05793.002},

abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neuromodulator in the nervous system implicated in many forms of cognitive and motor processing. Recent studies have used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) protein under the control of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter (ChAT–ChR2–EYFP) to dissect cholinergic circuit connectivity and function using optogenetic approaches. We report that a mouse line used for this purpose also carries several copies of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter gene (VAChT), which leads to overexpression of functional VAChT and consequently increased cholinergic tone. We demonstrate that these mice have marked improvement in motor endurance. However, they also present severe cognitive deficits, including attention deficits and dysfunction in working memory and spatial memory. These results suggest that increased VAChT expression may disrupt critical steps in information processing.

abstract = {The intracellular transport of organelles, proteins, lipids, and RNA along the axon is essential for neuronal function and survival. This process, called axonal transport, is mediated by two classes of ATP-dependent motors, kinesins, and cytoplasmic dynein, which carry their cargoes along microtubule tracks. Protein kinases regulate axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motors, adapter proteins, and cargoes, and indirectly through modification of the microtubule network. The misregulation of axonal transport by protein kinases has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several nervous system disorders. Here, we review the role of protein kinases acting directly on axonal transport and discuss how their deregulation affects neuronal function, paving the way for the exploitation of these enzymes as novel drug targets. Axonal transport of organelles, proteins, lipids, and RNA is essential for neuronal function and survival. Protein kinases have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of this process.Protein kinases regulate axonal transport through direct phosphorylation of motor complexes, adapter proteins, and cargoes, and indirectly through modification of the microtubule network.The diversity of protein kinases implicated in the regulation of axonal transport likely underlies the complexity of this process and explains why transport characteristics are distinct between different types of neurons and cargoes.Deregulation of axonal transport by protein kinases has been linked to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Protein kinases may therefore represent novel therapeutic targets for neurological diseases that currently lack effective therapies.},
