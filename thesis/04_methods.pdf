\section{Animals}
\label{sec:animal}
All experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Swiss Federal Act on Animal Protection and Swiss Animal Protection Ordinance.
For this study we employed VIP-tdTomato/ChAT-ChR2-EYFP and PV-tdTomato/ChAT-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice lines (see chapter introduction). 
The mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane () and chemically fixed via transcardial perfusion of 10 ml of isotonic phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by 200 ml of 1 \% glutaraldehyde and 2\% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4).\\ 
The perfused animals lied in room temperature for 2 h and then the brains were removed from the skull and placed in support forms containing 5 \% standard agarose (Eurobio) dissolved in PBS. After cooling for a few minutes, the agarose gel containing the brain were placed in a vibratome chamber (Leica VT1200 S) , and 80 µm thick slices were sectioned coronally in PBS.\\
\section{Fluorescence and light microscopy}
\label{sec:FM}
To visualize tdTomato and EYFP expression in the transgenic mice, I used an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700 Invert). I acquired Z-stacks with 2 µm distance between images starting at 40X magnification, then 20 X, to finally 10 X to have a bigger overview. I collected the emission of EYFP and tdTomato respectively at 488 and 546 nm of wavelength. Additionally, I imaged at transmitted light through a PMT detector, allowing me to detect specific slice morphological landmarks (e.g blood vessels).\\

To maintain tissue quality and the ultrastructure morphology, I kept the brain slices continuosly in PBS, also during confocal imaging. To this end, a  in special custom-made chambers consisting of slide, parafilm and coverglass (fig.  \ref{fig:chamber} was build. In the parafilm layer a small window was created where a drop of PBS and the slice were placed.\\
Consequently, the slices were brought under a dissecting light microscope (Leica M205 C) integrated with a camera (Leica MC170 HD). The brain slices were divided along the midline. Low magnification images of the half imaged with the confocal microscope captured the entire, and the higher magnifications of the region of interest.\\
\section{Tissue and block preparation for electron microscopy}
\label{sec:EM} 
\subsection{Tissue embedding}
\label{sec:tissue embedding}
Following the fluorescence and light microscopy, these slices were then stained
and embedded using methods described in Knott et al. (2011). The slices were washed in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4, 3 × 5 min), post fixed in 2\% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 19110) and 1.5\% potassium ferrocyanide (Sigma 14459-95-1) in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4, 40 min). They were then stained with 2\% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 40 min, and then in 1\% uranyl acetate at 4°C overnight. Then the sections are stained in lead aspartate for 2 h, dehydrated in graded alcohol series for 5 min. Finally, the sections are left in Durcupan resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 13600) and ethanol solution (1:1) for 30 min. Between each step, the sections were washed in distilled water at RT. After infiltrating overnight, the sections were placed between two glass slides coated in a mold separating agent (Glorex Inspirations, Switzerland; 62407445) and placed in the oven at 65°C for 24 h. 
\subsection{Alignment and block preparation}
\label{sec:block prep}
After Durcupan resin polymerization, the glass slides were separated and the slices were stabilized in a thin resin layer. Considering that the sections are impregnated with heavy metals and darkened to transmitted light, entire slices were overlaid and aligned with the image of the same section before undergoing heavy metal staining. This step allowed me to locate the region of interest. I aligned the images in Adobe Photoshop software by carefully matching the section edges to identify the region of interest which was then removed by using a razor blade and glued to the SEM pin (Micro to Nano place, 10-006002-50) with an electrically conductive epoxy resin (Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA, USA, 16043). The pin is left overnight at 65°C to polymerize. 
Then I trimmed the block using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UCT) and glass knife. After each trimming step, an image of the block is taken. At this point the block has a quadrilateral block face which can result confusing. Therefore, a final trimming is performed to create an angle (\ref{label}. 
\section{Serial Block-Face EM imaging}
\label{sec:3View}
Before loading the sample into the SEM microscope (Merlin, Zeiss NTS) fitted with the 3View cutting system (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA), a 40  nm gold coating is performed (Quorum Technologies; Q300T). The first cuts are conducted while the microscope chamber is open to remove the gold coating. Then we closed and pumped down to high vacuum. Next a low resolution scanning of the block face is acquired to reveal the position of blood vessels found also in the fluorescence images. To choose the recording region, I performed a final overlay of the EM block face overview to the alignments conducted during block preparation. Then the imaging window was positioned onto the region of interest. We proceeded in approaching mode where thick sections were removed until we were close to the z-depth of interest. During this process, I compared the block face low resolution images with the different fluorescent images. For imaging we used the following settings: EHT = 1.7 kV; current beam = 300 pA; knife cutting speed = 0.3 mm/sec; backscatter detector = on; image size = 6000 x 6000 pixels, resolution = 6.5 nm x and y; slice thickness = 50 nm. We activated several tile to image a bigger field of recording.
\section{EM image processing, segmentation and 3D model generation}
\label{sec:fiji}
The raw stacks of images coming from the microscope computer had to be processed. To this end, I used ImageJ/Fiji software which contains TrackEM plugin. This allowed me to first align, then trace the structures of interest to finally generate my 3D models. The images were aligned as files belonging to one single tile and between tiles. The tiles were imported as stacks into a TrackEM blank file, placed roughly aligned. Then the alignment function was run overnight to finally obtain an .xml file. This file was opened in TrackEM to perform the segmentation process. It consisted in tracing manually each structure of interest along the stack which on average contained around 800 slices. Once the tracing was concluded, the area lists (elements used to segment the EM images) were open in 3D view and exported as wavefront (.obj files). These files were then imported and processed in Blender software. 
\section{Blender and 3D model processing}
\label{sec:blender}
Blender allowed me to handle 3D models obtained by TrackEM. Each object (previous area list) is imported into the Blender workspace. First, the object undergoes re-meshing to reduce its weight. Blender has been implemented with adds-on functions called Neuromorph (open source, github), developed at the BioEM Facility (Jorstad et al. 2018). This implementation enable the measurement of surfaces, lengths and volumes. Thus, I used it to measure synapse size, cell body volumes and various lengths.
